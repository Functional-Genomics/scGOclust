Title: Leverage Gene Ontology to Measure Cell Type Similarity Between Single Cell RNA-Seq Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yuyao Song  <ysong@ebi.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Yuyao Song  <ysong@ebi.ac.uk>
Description: Comparing cell types between scRNA-seq datasets from a functional perspective requires analysis beyond gene expression. Here we use Gene Ontology terms to represent cell type expression profiles and calculate the profile similarity between scRNA-seq datasets, thus finding cell types with similar biological processes.
