Title: Leveraging Gene Ontology to Measure Cell Type Similarity Between Single Cell RNA-Seq Datasets
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Comparing cell types between scRNA-seq datasets from a functional perspective requires analysis beyond gene expression. Here we use Gene Ontology terms as features to represent cell type expression profiles and calculate the profile similarity between scRNA-seq datasets. By doing so, this package enables discovery of cell types having similar or inversely regulated biological processes. Various visualozation functions are also provided for results inspection.
